In this mini project, I have utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an entertaining and interactive ping-pong game. Engage in a friendly competition with your friends as you aim to score the maximum number of points by hitting the ball past your opponent.

## Key Features :

* **Game Interface:** The game features a visually appealing interface that resembles a ping-pong table. The layout includes a play area, paddles for both players, and a scoring system to track the points earned by each player.

* **Player Controls:** Take control of your paddle using intuitive controls. Move your paddle left and right using keyboard keys, allowing you to position your paddle and hit the ball with precision.

* **Ball Movement:** Experience realistic ball movement as it bounces between the paddles. The ball moves dynamically, responding to the angle and speed at which it is hit, making each rally unpredictable and exciting.

* **Scoring System:** The game keeps track of each player's score in real-time. When a player successfully hits the ball past their opponent's paddle, they earn a point. The scoring system displays the current score, allowing players to keep an eye on their progress.

* **Game Over and Restart:** When one player reaches the maximum score, the game ends. A "Game Over" message is displayed, and players have the option to restart the game for another round of fun and competition.

* **Responsive Design:** The game is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices. Whether you play it on a desktop computer, tablet, or mobile phone, the game interface adjusts accordingly, ensuring an enjoyable gaming experience.
